			<title>Aries Horoscope for Wednesday, February 12, 2014</title>
			<description>If you start to take better care of your body, it will begin to take better care of you. You may not have been feeling quite up to par lately and a poor diet or lack of exercise could be to blame. Take a good look at what you`ve been eating and if you haven`t been getting enough of the required daily vitamins, take steps to reform your regimen for the better. Make sure you also incorporate a healthy dose of exercise and get plenty of rest. Total overall health can be yours, but you have to be willing to make more of an effort.</description>
